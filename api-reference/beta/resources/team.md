# team resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A team in Microsoft Teams is a collection of [channel](channel.md) objects. A channel represents a topic, and therefore a logical isolation of discussion, within a team.

Every team is associated with a [group](../resources/group.md). The group has the same ID as the team - for example, `/groups/{id}/team` is the same as `/teams/{id}`. For more information about working with groups and members in teams, see [Use the Microsoft Graph REST API to work with Microsoft Teams](teams-api-overview.md).
