# chat resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A chat is a collection of [chatMessages](chatmessage.md) between one or more participants. Participants can be users or apps.

## Methods

|  Method       |  Return Type  | Description| Permissions |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|-----------|
|[List chats](../api/chat-list.md) | [chat](channel.md) collection | Get the list of chats a user is part of.| **Delegated only** |
|[Get chat](../api/chat-get.md) | [chat](channel.md) | Read properties and relationships of the chat.| **Delegated only** |
|[List chat members](../api/conversationmember-list.md) | [conversationmember](conversationmember.md) collection | Get the list of all users in the chat.| Delegated and application* |
|[Get chat member](../api/conversationmember-get.md) | [conversationmember](conversationmember.md) | Get a single user in the chat.| Delegated and application* |
|[List messages in a chat](../api/chatmessage-list.md)  | [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) | Get messages in a 1:1 or group chat. | Delegated and application* |
|[Get message in chat](../api/chatmessage-get.md)  | [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) | Get a single message in a chat. | Delegated and application* |

\*> **Note:** When using application permissions, be sure you know how you're going to get the chat ID. Because listing chats with application permissions is not supported, 
not all scenarios are possible. It is possible to get chat IDs with delegated permissions, and from [change notifications for /chats/allMessages](../api/subscription-post-subscriptions.md) with application permissions.
