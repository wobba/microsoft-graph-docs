# Highlights of earlier releases

## May 2020: New and generally available

### Calendar | Place
GA of the [places API](/graph/api/resources/place) in v1.0 - use this API in production apps to get, update, or delete a [room](/graph/api/resources/room) or [room list](/graph/api/resources/roomlist) in a tenant. [Find out more](outlook-calendar-concept-overview.md#build-apps-with-location-awareness-and-provide-intelligent-context) about the places API.

### Change notifications
- Subscribe to change notifications in Microsoft Cloud for US Government.

### Cloud communications | Call records
- GA of the [call records API](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) - use the [callRecord](/graph/api/resources/callrecord?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource to get the metadata of calls and online meetings on Microsoft Teams and Skype.
- Subscribe to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks) for changes to all **callRecord** resources in an organization.
- [List sessions](/graph/api/callrecords-session-list?view=graph-rest-1.0) in a **callRecord**, and optionally [expand each session to list segments](/graph/api/callrecords-session-list?view=graph-rest-1.0#example-2-get-session-list-with-segments) in the call record.
- Support for 60-GHz (`frequency60GHz`) and `unknownFutureValue` WiFi band values of a media endpoint in a segment.
- Support for voice mail as a possible type of service-side end point in a communication [segment](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-segment).

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune [May](changelog.md#may-2020) updates in v1.0.

### Graph Explorer
Use the many new features of [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) that enhance learning and prototyping in the sandbox. For example:
- View code snippets that correspond to the REST API query you entered, in C#, Java, JavaScript, and Objective C.
- Signed in with a tenant, view and copy an access token to your favorite REST client application.

See [New Graph Explorer is now GA](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/new-graph-explorer-is-now-ga/) for more details.

### Groups
- Synchronizing on-premises directory to Azure Active Directory via Azure AD Connect now returns the **onPremisesDomainName**, **onPremisesNetBiosName** and **onPremisesSamAccountName** properties as part of the [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource.
- Subscribe to change notifications for [group](/graph/api/resources/group) resources in Microsoft Cloud China operated by 21Vianet.

### Identity and access
- GA of the service principals API in v1.0 - use the [servicePrincipal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource in production apps to programmatically manage instances of applications and control what an application can do within your tenant. You can control who can use an application, what resources the application has access to, such as adding password credentials, rolling expiring certificates, and managing delegated permission grants and application role assignments.
- GA of the [appRoleAssignment](/graph/api/resources/appRoleAssignment?view=graph-rest-1.0) API, which records the assignment of an [appRole](/graph/api/resources/approle?view=graph-rest-1.0) (representing the `roles` claim in ID tokens and access tokens) to a [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0), [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [servicePrincipal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Use Facebook as an identity provider on Azure Active Directory.
- Use the delegated or application permission of `AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All` to allow an app to manage grants for application permissions to any API (including Microsoft Graph) and application assignments for any app, respectively with or without the signed-in user.


### Microsoft Graph SDKs
See new SDK guidance on the following:
- [Paging](/graph/sdks/paging)
- [Batching](/graph/sdks/batch-requests)
- [Uploading large files on OneDrive](/graph/sdks/large-file-upload)
- [Customizing SDK service client through HTTP middleware components](/graph/sdks/customize-client).

### Teamwork
- If your scenario involves online meetings on Teams, see new guidance on [how to choose](choose-online-meeting-api.md) between the [calendar API](outlook-calendar-online-meetings.md) and [cloud communications API](cloud-communications-online-meetings.md) to create and join online meetings.
- [Send](/graph/api/channel-post-messages?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [reply](/graph/api/channel-post-messagereply?view=graph-rest-1.0) to messages in a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Get the OneDrive for Business location of the files for a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-1.0), by using the **fileFolder** navigation property.

### Teamwork | Shifts
GA of the [shifts API](/graph/api/resources/shift?view=graph-rest-1.0) in v1.0 - use this API in production apps to create, update, and manage schedules of firstline workers, to let them stay in touch and collaborate effectively.

### Users
- Subscribe to change notifications for [user](/graph/api/resources/user) resources in Microsoft Cloud China operated by 21Vianet.
- Track the status and date/time of the last status change of an external user, who has been [invited](/graph/api/invitation-post?view=graph-rest-1.0) to join the organization, by using the **externalUserState** and **externalUserStateChangeDateTime** properties of the **user** resource.

## May 2020: New in preview only

### Change notifications
- Use formally schematized types [changeNotification](/graph/api/resources/changenotification?view=graph-rest-beta) and [changeNotificationCollection](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection?view=graph-rest-beta) to process resource change notifications. 
- Track if notifications are in sequence or if a notification is missing by using the **sequenceNumber** property on the **changeNotification** resource.

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
- The [printer](/graph/api/resources/printer?view=graph-rest-beta) and [printerShare](/graph/api/resources/printershare?view=graph-rest-beta) resources are now in parity and have the same properties as each other.
- Some property and type name clean-up around printer shares:
  - Use the **shared** navigation property of [print](/graph/api/resources/print?view=graph-rest-beta) to get the list of printer shares registered in the tenant. 
  - See details in the [May](changelog.md#may-2020) changelog.

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune [May](changelog.md#may-2020) updates in beta.

### Groups
- [Evaluate](/graph/api/group-evaluatedynamicmembership?view=graph-rest-beta) whether a user or device is or would be a member of a dynamic group, using the existing rule for the [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta) or a specified rule. [Rule-based dynamic membership](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership) reduces administrative overhead of adding and removing members.
- When creating a Microsoft 365 [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta), configure the behaviors of the group by specifying them in the **resourceBehaviorOptions** property. For example, allow members to post, subscribe new members to conversation, disable welcome email, and hide the group in Outlook experiences.
- Specify the resources to provision in the **resourceProvisioningOptions** property that are normally not part of the default [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta) creation. Currently supported is provisioning a group as a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta) with Microsoft Teams capabilities.

### Identity and access
- Apply OData system query options (`$count`, `$filter`, `$search`) when getting collections of entities that are derived from [directoryObject](). 
You can [search for specific tokens](/graph/query-parameters?#using-search-on-directory-object-collections) in the **displayName** and **description** properties 
of these entities, and use OData cast to trim **directoryObject** results to certain derived types. See more details in 
[Build advanced queries in Microsoft Graph with $count, $filter, $search, and $orderby](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/build-advanced-queries-with-count-filter-search-and-orderby/).
- As part of the [identity protection API](/graph/api/resources/identityprotection-root?view=graph-rest-beta), use the **riskEventType** property to [get the type of risk detected](/graph/api/riskdetection-get?view=graph-rest-beta), or [get the type of risk in a user's history](/graph/api/riskyuser-list-history?view=graph-rest-beta). Do not use the **riskType** property as it has been deprecated.
- Specify client application types in the **clientAppTypes** property of the [condition set](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessconditionset?view=graph-rest-beta) for a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-beta).
- Use the delegated permission of `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` to allow an app to read access packages and related entitlement management resources on behalf of the signed-in user.
- Use the delegated or application permissions of `Application.Read.All` and `Application.ReadWrite.All` to [list applications](/graph/api/application-list?view=graph-rest-beta) in an organization.
- Control authorization settings in Azure AD using the [authorizationPolicy](/graph/api/resources/authorizationpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) resource type.

### Teamwork
- Teams apps that [support single sign-on (SSO)](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso) can specify the `WebApplicationInfo.id` from the Teams app manifest, in the **azureADAppId** property of the [teamsAppDefinition](/graph/api/resources/teamsappdefinition?view=graph-rest-beta).
- Use [finer grained permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#teams-resource-specific-consent-permissions) to access [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta) and [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta) resources.


## April 2020: New and generally available

### Calendar
- [Share or delegate calendars](outlook-share-or-delegate-calendar.md) programmatically, in closer parity with the Outlook user experience. In addition to tracking the current user's permissions and sharing status for a calendar:
  - For each [calendar](/graph/api/resources/calendar?view=graph-rest-1.0), you can now manage the [permissions](/graph/api/resources/calendarpermission?view=graph-rest-1.0) of each user with whom the calendar is shared. 
  - For each [mailbox](/graph/api/resources/mailboxsettings?view=graph-rest-1.0), you can now specify whether a delegate, mailbox owner, or both receive meeting messages and meeting responses. 
- [Create or update an event as an online meeting](outlook-calendar-online-meetings.md):
  - For each **calendar**, specify the allowed and the default online meeting providers.
  - Create or update an [event](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0) to be available online, and provide details for attendees to join the meeting online. 
  - In particular, use the new **onlineMeetingProvider** and **onlineMeeting** properties of **event** to set or identify Microsoft Teams as an online meeting provider, a workaround for a [known issue](known-issues.md#onlinemeetingurl-property-support-for-microsoft-teams) with the **onlineMeetingUrl** property.
- Add [file attachments up to 150MB](outlook-large-attachments.md) to an [event](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0).

### Files
- [Check out](/graph/api/driveitem-checkout?view=graph-rest-1.0) or [check in](/graph/api/driveitem-checkin?view=graph-rest-1.0) a file to OneDrive to manage updating the file and making updates available to others when the updates are ready.
- Apply optional password and expiration date/time as parameters of the [invite](/graph/api/driveitem-invite?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [create sharing link](/graph/api/driveitem-createlink?view=graph-rest-1.0) actions to share a [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Get or set password and expiration date/time of a [permission](/graph/api/resources/permission?view=graph-rest-1.0), and track the [identitySet](/graph/api/resources/identityset?view=graph-rest-1.0) of users granted the permission to share a **driveItem**.
- Get the [permission](/graph/api/resources/permission?view=graph-rest-1.0) of a [shared drive item](/graph/api/resources/shareddriveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) by using the **permission** navigation property.
- Limit users with a [sharing link](/graph/api/resources/sharinglink?view=graph-rest-1.0) to only view and may not download the contents of a shared**driveItem** on OneDrive for Business or SharePoint.

### Identity and access
- To manage roles and assign access to resources in role-based access control (RBAC) providers such as Microsoft Intune, use [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](/graph/api/resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple?view=graph-rest-1.0). The **unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple** resource supports defining a single role over an array of scopes, and assigning the role to multiple principals (such as users).
- Access specific types of [policies for an organization](/graph/api/resources/policy-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) using the `/policies` URL segment and specifying the policy type. For example, an organization can enforce a policy to automatically sign a user out from a web session after a period of inactivity; see CRUD operations for instances of [activityBasedTimeoutPolicy](/graph/api/resources/activitybasedtimeoutpolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0). This is a [breaking change](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/breaking-changes-policy-api-microsoft-graph-1.0/) to make it easier to discover all policies, by grouping all typed policies under the `/policies` segment. Access other typed policies in a similar approach: [claimsMappingPolicy](/graph/api/resources/claimsmappingpolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0), [homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy](/graph/api/resources/homerealmdiscoverypolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0), [tokenLifetimePolicy](/graph/api/resources/tokenlifetimepolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0), and [tokenIssuancePolicy](/graph/api/resources/tokenissuancetimepolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0). 

### Mail
Add [file attachments up to 150MB](outlook-large-attachments.md) to a [message](/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0).

### Sites and lists
- [List sites](/graph/api/sites-list-followed?view=graph-rest-1.0) that the signed-in user has followed.
- Identify the geographic region of a [site collection](/graph/api/resources/sitecollection?view=graph-rest-1.0) by using the **dataLocationCode** property.
- Identify the tenant of a file, folder, or other item on SharePoint by accessing the **tenantId** property that is part of the **sharepointIds** of a [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0).

For example, [reset a user password](/graph/api/passwordauthenticationmethod-resetpassword?view=graph-rest-beta) and [get the reset status](/graph/api/authenticationoperation-get?view=graph-rest-beta), or [add a phone number](/graph/api/authentication-post-phonemethods?view=graph-rest-beta) for a user for SMS or voice call authentication, if the policy is enabled for the user.

### Reports | Identity and access reports
[List](/graph/api/relyingpartydetailedsummary-list?view=graph-rest-beta) [relying parties](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/understanding-key-ad-fs-concepts) configured in Active Directory Federation Services.

## March 2020: New and generally available

### Cloud communications
- Get the call routing and incoming context of a [call](/graph/api/resources/call?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- [Update the recording status](/graph/api/call-updaterecordingstatus?view=graph-rest-1.0) of a call.
- Specify recording information for a [participant](/graph/api/resources/participant?view=graph-rest-1.0), including the initiator and status of the recording.

- Use the **riskEventTypes_v2** property to get the risk event types associated with a [sign-in](/graph/api/resources/signin?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Use the `User.ManageIdentities.All` delegated permission to allow an app to read, update, or delete identities that are associated with a user's account, that the signed-in user has access to. Use that permission at the application-level without a signed-in user present. This allows the app to [manage](/graph/api/user-update?view=graph-rest-1.0) which identities a user can sign-in with.

### Reports
Use Teams Service Administrator and Teams Communications Administrator as accepted user roles to allow apps to read Microsoft 365 service usage reports on behalf of a user, as [forms of user-delegated authorization](reportroot-authorization.md).

### Calendar
- Use the **calendarGroupId** property to get the [calendar group](/graph/api/resources/calendargroup?view=graph-rest-beta) in which a [calendar](/graph/api/resources/calendar?view=graph-rest-beta) has been created.
- Use the **isDraft** property to identify an [event](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-beta) as a meeting that the user has updated in Outlook but has not sent to update attendees.

### Cloud communications
- Use [createOrGet](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?view=graph-rest-beta) to get an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta) instance by a custom external ID, and create one when none already exists.
- Have the option to use the **externalId** property to identify an online meeting with the custom external ID.
- Use the optional `Accept-Language` HTTP request header to [create](/graph/api/application-post-onlinemeetings?view=graph-rest-beta) or [get](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-get?view=graph-rest-beta) an instance of online meeting, so that the successful operation displays the content of the **joinInformation** property in the specified language and locale variant.

### Devices and apps
Intune [March](changelog.md#march-2020) updates.

### Identity and access
- Use the `Auditlogs.Read.All` permission to list the [sign-in activity](/graph/api/resources/signinactivity?view=graph-rest-beta) of a [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-beta).
- Use the `PrivilegedAccess.Read.AzureResources` application-level permission for [Privileged Identity Management (PIM) of Azure resources](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-resources?view=graph-rest-beta), to set up just-in-time access workflow for Azure infrastructure roles at a management group, subscription, resource group, or resource level.
- Use the [identitySecurityDefaultsEnforcementPolicy](/graph/api/resources/identitysecuritydefaultsenforcementpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) entity to [get](/graph/api/identitysecuritydefaultsenforcementpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta) or [update](/graph/api/identitysecuritydefaultsenforcementpolicy-update?view=graph-rest-beta) pre-configured default security settings that protect organizations against common attacks.
- Use an `identity` segment when calling the conditional access APIs. For example, to [get](/graph/api/conditionalaccesspolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta) a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-beta): `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/{id}`.
- Use the **authenticationRequirement** property to get the highest level of authentication that is needed through all the sign-in steps in order for [sign-in](/graph/api/resources/signin?view=graph-rest-beta) to succeed.
- Use pagination when [listing provisioning events](/graph/api/provisioningobjectsummary-list?view=graph-rest-beta) that occurred in your tenant.

### Search
- To add data in a file to search results, index the data simply as an [externalItem](/graph/api/resources/externalitem?view=graph-rest-beta). The **externalFile** type has been deprecated.
- [Update](/graph/api/externalitem-update?view=graph-rest-beta) an [item in the index](/graph/api/resources/externalitem?view=graph-rest-beta), by specifically updating the plain-text representation of the item (represented by the **content** property), or the properties bag of the item (represented by the **properties** property). Updating any property in the properties bag overwrites the entire properties bag, so make sure to explicitly include all the properties of the item in the update.
- Check for `HTTP 429` and the `Retry-After` response header after calling the [create](/graph/api/externalconnection-put-items?view=graph-rest-beta), [update](/graph/api/externalitem-update?view=graph-rest-beta), or [delete](/graph/api/externalitem-delete?view=graph-rest-beta) operation of **externalItem**. Backing off requests using the `Retry-After` delay is the fastest way to recover from [throttling](throttling.md#best-practices-to-handle-throttling).

### Teamwork
Use the `ChannelMessage.Read.All` application-level permission to read [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage?view=graph-rest-beta) instances in channels without a signed-in user.

### Universal Print
Debut of the [Universal Print API](universal-print-concept-overview.md) which allows users to print on the web or from an app. The API lets IT administrators manage user and group access to printers in the Microsoft 365 cloud, remote printer sharing to maintain availability, monitor printer status, and report on archived print jobs and usage. 

Note that as of March 2020, the Universal Print _service_ is in private preview. See [Announcing Universal Print: a cloud-based print solution](https://aka.ms/announcinguniversalprint) for information regarding participation.


## February 2020: New and generally available

### Calendar
Walk through an example of [creating an event in a shared or delegated calendar](outlook-create-event-in-shared-delegated-calendar.md), and the actions and properties available to the delegate, invitees, and calendar owner during this process.

### Identity and access
- To improve security when subscribing to [change notifications of user data](webhooks.md), [enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2) or higher on clients and site servers used in the notification process. The new requirement is rolled out in stages starting February 15 2020. By May 15, 2020, all notification endpoints must meet the new TLS requirement. [Find out the stages of the rollout](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/microsoft-graph-subscriptions-deprecating-tls-1-0-and-1-1/) and if necessary, use the new **latestSupportedTlsVersion** property as a temporary workaround to avoid subscription failures, before completing the TLS upgrade.
- Use respective types of [threat assessment request](/graph/api/resources/threatAssessmentRequest?view=graph-rest-1.0) to track threats from [mail](/graph/api/resources/mailassessmentrequest?view=graph-rest-1.0), an [email message file](/graph/api/resources/emailfileassessmentrequest?view=graph-rest-1.0) (.EML file), [email attachment file](/graph/api/resources/fileassessmentrequest?view=graph-rest-1.0) (text, Word, or binary file), or [URL](/graph/api/resources/urlassessmentrequest?view=graph-rest-1.0).

### Users
[Reprocess](/graph/api/user-reprocesslicenseassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0) all group-based license assignments for a [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0).


## February 2020: New in preview only

### Calendar
See [tasks supported by preview APIs that manage calendar sharing and delegation](outlook-share-or-delegate-calendar.md).

### Cloud communications

- Use the new [call records](/graph/api/resources/callrecord?view=graph-rest-beta) resource to get metadata of calls and online meetings on Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business for an organization.
- For a participant in a meeting, use the **initiator** property to get the identity information of the initiator of a [recording](/graph/api/resources/recordinginfo?view=graph-rest-beta), if there is one.

### Devices and apps
Intune [February](changelog.md#february-2020) updates.

### Groups
Use the [assignLicense](/graph/api/group-assignlicense?view=graph-rest-beta) method to assign licences for products, such as Microsoft 365 or Enterprise Mobility + Security, to a group. Since Azure AD ensures licences are assigned to members of the group, members joining or leaving a group no longer requires licence management at the individual level.

### Identity and access
- Set requestor, approval, and review settings when creating an [access package assignment policy](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta).
- Access specific types of [policies for an organization](/graph/api/resources/policy-overview?view=graph-rest-beta) using the `/policies` URL segment and specifying the policy type. For example, an organization can enforce a policy to automatically sign a user out from a web session after a period of inactivity; see CRUD operations for instances of [activityBasedTimeoutPolicy](/graph/api/resources/activitybasedtimeoutpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta). This is a [breaking change](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/breaking-changes-policy-api-microsoft-graph-beta/) to make it easier to discover all policies, by grouping all typed policies under the `/policies` segment. Access other typed policies in a similar approach: [claimsMappingPolicy](/graph/api/resources/claimsmappingpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta), [homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy](/graph/api/resources/homerealmdiscoverypolicy?view=graph-rest-beta), [tokenLifetimePolicy](/graph/api/resources/tokenlifetimepolicy?view=graph-rest-beta), and [tokenIssuancePolicy](/graph/api/resources/tokenissuancetimepolicy?view=graph-rest-beta). 
- Use application-level and delegated `Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration` permission for read and write operations on application configuration [policies](/graph/api/resources/policy-overview?view=graph-rest-beta) mentioned in the preceding item.

### Teamwork
- Use [change notifications](/graph/api/resources/webhooks?view=graph-rest-beta) on all channel messages or all chat messages in an organization.
- [Decline](/graph/api/swapshiftschangerequest-decline?view=graph-rest-beta) a [request to swap shifts](/graph/api/resources/swapshiftschangerequest?view=graph-rest-beta) with another user in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta).

### Cloud communications
The cloud communications API has GA'd and APIs for [call](/graph/api/resources/call?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-1.0) are [available in v1.0](/graph/api/resources/communications-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).

### Education
Use the **classSettings** property to manage class-specific settings, such as enabling the sending of weekly assignment digests. This property is available on the [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource when the team represents an [education class](/graph/api/resources/educationclass?view=graph-rest-1.0).

### Identity and access 
[Attempting to get container objects with limited permissions returns partial data](permissions-reference.md#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects). An example is a [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) instance that's associated with a [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0), another **group**, and a [device](/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-1.0). An app having only the permissions User.Read.All and Group.Read.All and attempting to access this **group** instance would get the **user** and **group** objects, but limited data for the **device** object (only data type and object ID and not property values).

### People and workplace intelligence
The insights API has GA'd. Use the API in production apps to identify the most relevant documents that are:

- [Trending around](/graph/api/insights-list-trending?view=graph-rest-1.0) a user
- [Used by](/graph/api/insights-list-used?view=graph-rest-1.0) a user
- [Shared with or shared by](/graph/api/insights-list-shared?view=graph-rest-1.0) a user

### Reports
To get Microsoft 365 usage reports using permissions delegated by a user, administrators must have assigned the user an Azure AD limited administrator role. This can be one of the following roles: company administrator, Exchange administrator, SharePoint administrator, Lync administrator, global reader, or reports reader. See [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](reportroot-authorization.md) for details.

### Toolkit

### Education
Administrators can enable class-wide settings through the **classSettings** property of the [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta) associated with the [class](/graph/api/resources/educationclass?view=graph-rest-beta). Currently, there is a setting to notify guardians about weekly assignments.

### Identity and access
- Use the application permission, Policy.Read.All, to read all your organization's conditional access policies and named locations, without a signed-in user present.
- Allow a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) to be in a report-only state, `enabledForReportingButNotEnforced`.
- Use the delegated permission, ThreatAssessment.ReadWrite.All, or application permission, ThreatAssessment.Read.All, to read (or create, if read/write permission) requests to assess threats in an organization.

Now, you can use the [analytics API](/graph/api/resources/social-overview?view=graph-rest-beta#help-users-gain-insights-into-their-work-patterns) to integrate data on time spent on work activities such as calls, chats, and email, to help improve a user's productivity and wellbeing. 


## July 2019: New and generally available 

### Example code snippets
There are now Objective-C code snippets in all API topics in the v1.0 and beta references. See the Objective-C example for [getting an event](/graph/api/event-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=objective-c#example).

### Group
- Use the [validateProperties](/graph/api/group-validateproperties?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to make sure the display name or mail nickname of an existing Microsoft 365 group complies with naming policies.
- Alternatively, before creating the group, you can use the [validateProperties](/graph/api/directoryobject-validateproperties?view=graph-rest-1.0) function for a [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) to validate the names first.

### Identity and access
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#organization-permissions), _Organization.Read.All_ and _Organization.ReadWrite.All_, to access an [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization?view=graph-rest-1.0) and related resources such as [subscribed SKUs](/graph/api/resources/subscribedsku?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- Use [new delegated and application permissions](permissions-reference.md#role-management-permissions), _RoleManagement.Read.Directory_ and _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_, for role-based access control (RBAC) for your company's directory:

  - Use the read/write permission to first [activate](/graph/api/directoryrole-post-directoryroles?view=graph-rest-1.0) a directory role. 
  - With the role activated, you can use the read permission to [read directory roles](/graph/api/directoryrole-list?view=graph-rest-1.0), [list role members](/graph/api/directoryrole-list-members?view=graph-rest-1.0), and [list directory role templates](/graph/api/directoryroletemplate-list?view=graph-rest-1.0). 
  - You can also use the read/write permission to [add](/graph/api/directoryrole-post-members?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [remove](/graph/api/directoryrole-delete-member?view=graph-rest-1.0) role members.

## May - June, 2019: New and generally available

### Calendar, mail, and personal contacts
Exchange administrators can grant application permissions to an app and [limit the app to access only a subset of mailboxes](auth-limit-mailbox-access.md), instead of the default which is access to all mailboxes in the organization. Such restricted access would apply to any application permissions granted to the app for [calendars](permissions-reference.md#calendars-permissions), [contacts](permissions-reference.md#contacts-permissions), and [mail and mailbox settings](permissions-reference.md#mail-permissions). See related [blog announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/scoping-microsoft-graph-application-permissions-to-specific-exchange-online-mailboxes/).

### Mail
Use [mail search folders](/graph/api/resources/mailsearchfolder?view=graph-rest-1.0) API to search messages and access Outlook email search results. See related [blog announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/mail-search-folder-support-for-microsoft-graph-apis/).
